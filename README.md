# Movie Booking App

Welcome to the Movie Booking App! This iOS application allows users to book movie tickets, select showtimes, add snacks, and save tickets for later. The app is built using UIKit.

## Features

### Browse and Select Movies
Users can browse through a wide range of movies available for booking. The catalog includes various genres such as action, drama, comedy, thriller, and more.
Each movie listing provides detailed information including duration, and user ratings. This helps users make an informed decision.


### Choose Date and Time for Showtimes
An interactive calendar allows users to select the preferred date for their movie. The calendar displays available dates and showtimes in an intuitive manner.
Once a date is selected, users can choose from various available time slots. Each time slot shows the start time of the movie.


### Add Snacks to Your Order
Users can choose from a variety of snacks including popcorn, nachos, drinks, and candy. The snack menu is regularly updated to include new items.
Users can specify the quantity and, for some items, select size or flavor options. This ensures that they get exactly what they want.

### Save and View Booked Tickets
After selecting a movie, date, time, and snacks, users can review their entire order. They can make changes before confirming the booking.
Once confirmed, tickets are saved digitally within the app. Users can view their booked tickets anytime from the 'My Tickets' section.
Each booked ticket includes a QR code that can be scanned at the theater for quick entry. This eliminates the need for physical tickets.
